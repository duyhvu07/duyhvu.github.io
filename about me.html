        <p>
        I currently work for J.P Morgan Chase as a Business Intelligence Associate.
        When not working, I try to learn programming/computer science concepts. My goal is to
        equip myself with the necessary knolwedge to pursue a Master degree in Computer Science.
        </br>
        </br>
        My interests include soccer (the real football - cus you know, they actually use their feet to play <i class="em em-smiley" aria-role="presentation"
        aria-label="SMILING FACE WITH OPEN MOUTH"></i>), chess,
         non-fiction books, and concerts.
        I also find cooking therepeutic.
         </p>
        I enjoy <a href="travel.html">travelling</a>, I try to travel to at least one country
        a year. I believe one of the best way to grow is to be exposed to
        different cultures where one preconceived notions of how things work are tested and refined based on
        the differences and commonalities between each destination.
