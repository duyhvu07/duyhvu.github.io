        Jenkins, Cloud Foundry) as well as Product Management.
        </br>
        </br>
        My interests include soccer (the real football - cus you know, they actually use their feet to play <i class="em em-smiley" aria-role="presentation"
        aria-label="SMILING FACE WITH OPEN MOUTH"></i>), chess,
         non-fiction books, and concerts.
        I also find cooking therepeutic.
         </p>
        I enjoy <a href="travel.html">travelling</a>, I try to travel to at least one country
        a year. I believe one way to grow is to experience
        different cultures, where my preconceived notion of how the world work get challenged and refined.
