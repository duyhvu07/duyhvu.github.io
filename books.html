                <p class="card-text">Not the first Stoicism book I've read but the most impactful. It profoundly altered the ways I look at life and taught me to
                not only appreciate what I have but also stay detached so that I can maintain a sober persepective during hard times. I'm not religious, but this book is my equivalent of the Bible.</p>

              human rights are all what the author called imagined orders - beliefs that are shared between millions of our fellow homosapiens, and it's one

            <p class="card-text">This book provide great ideas as food for thoughts: your past does not determine who you are and
            that it's not external factors prevent you from making the change you want, but rather you yourself not wanting to make that change because you're
            subconsciously comfortable with how things are.
            This is only part of the bigger picture the book, and it's one of those book that I'd need to reread to fully comprehend the message.
